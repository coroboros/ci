## Pipelines

### `javascript-npm-packages.yml`

Bundled NPM CI.

Consumer requirements:
- `.node-version`
- `package.json` with
  - `packageManager: "pnpm@X.Y.Z"`, `scripts.lint`, `scripts.test`.
  - `scripts.build` is optional (auto-detected).
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` — required for `--frozen-lockfile`.

<details>
<summary><em>preflight</em></summary>

<br>

**Trigger**: `branch push`

**Sequence**:
1. Checkout
2. Run [`check-docs`](#composable-actions)
3. Run [`javascript/base`](#composable-actions)

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>security-gate</em></summary>

<br>

**Trigger**: `every push`. Gates `publish` via `needs:` — a release waits on it.

Calls [`security-gate.yml`](#security-gateyml): `osv-scanner` (`pnpm-lock.yaml` vs [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev/)) + `gitleaks` (full history). `javascript/base` already gates the install (Socket Firewall + `--frozen-lockfile`); the gate adds the known-CVE and leaked-secret blocks so a vulnerable dependency or a leaked secret stops the release through the job graph, not per-repo branch protection. See [Security](#security).

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>publish</em></summary>

<br>

**Trigger**: `tag push`. Gated by `security-gate` (`needs:`) — osv-scanner and gitleaks must pass first.

**Sequence**:
1. Checkout `main` with full history
2. Verify `main` HEAD matches the tag SHA via [`release/verify-tag`](#composable-actions)
3. Run [`check-docs`](#composable-actions)
4. Run [`javascript/base`](#composable-actions)
5. Pin `package.json` version to the tag
6. Generate `CHANGELOG.md` section via [`release/generate-changelog`](#composable-actions)
7. Publish to npm — OIDC + provenance or token-based via `.npmrc` (see [Security](#security))
8. Create GitHub Release via [`release/github-release`](#composable-actions)
9. Commit release artifacts back to `main` via [`release/commit-artifacts`](#composable-actions)

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>security</em></summary>

<br>

**Trigger**: `every call`

Calls the advisory [`security.yml`](#securityyml) — `dependency-review`, reporting only, never blocks the release. See [Security](#security).

</details>

### `rust-packages.yml`

Bundled Cargo CI. Tag-driven release, same as the npm pipeline.

Consumer requirements:
- `rust-toolchain.toml` — pins the channel. `rust/base` installs that channel explicitly with the `rustfmt` + `clippy` components (no reliance on lazy auto-resolution on first `cargo` use). The pipeline assumes `rustup` is on `PATH` (every GitHub-hosted runner ships it); a custom container image pinned for a `dist-build` target must provide it.
- `Cargo.toml` and a committed `Cargo.lock` — `clippy` and `test` run `--locked`.
- compile-time assets — any `include_str!` / `include_bytes!` / `build.rs` input must sit under the package root and stay unignored (no `exclude`/`.gitignore` rule drops it). The `package` job verify-builds the packaged crate so a dropped asset fails the PR, not the tagged publish.
- cargo-deny policy — imposed by `coroboros/ci`; no consumer `deny.toml` required, and a local one is ignored. See [Security](#security).
- `ci/setup.sh` — optional native build-dependency hook. Receives `RUNNER_OS`, `RUNNER_ARCH`, and `CARGO_DIST_TARGET` (space-separated target triples on a `dist-build` cross leg; empty on host preflight). Installs `-sys` / CMake toolchains and exports env via `$GITHUB_ENV`. No-op when absent.
- `ci/test.env` — optional. `KEY=value` lines loaded into the job environment before `cargo test`, so model/fixture-gated tests fail loud instead of skipping. No-op when absent.
- `ci/test-setup.sh` — optional. Runs before `cargo test` to stage test fixtures (prefetch a model, install a runtime tool). No-op when absent.
- crates.io publishing — configure [OIDC Trusted Publishing](#security), or set `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` to bootstrap the first publish of a new crate. Tagged builds always publish.
- binary distribution — optional. Declare `[package.metadata.dist]` in `Cargo.toml` (cargo-dist `0.32.0`) to attach prebuilt binaries and installers to the release; drop `release-plz`. cargo-dist `0.32` reads its workspace-global keys (`cargo-dist-version`, `ci`, `publish-jobs`) from `[workspace.metadata.dist]` only — a single-crate repo adds an empty `[workspace]` — and needs `allow-dirty = ["ci"]` there so `dist plan` doesn't claim its own workflow (this pipeline owns it). Absent → source-only (crates.io), unchanged.

2. Run [`check-docs`](#composable-actions)
3. Run [`rust/base`](#composable-actions)

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>security-gate</em></summary>

<br>

**Trigger**: `every push`. Gates `publish` via `needs:` — a release waits on it.

Calls [`security-gate.yml`](#security-gateyml): `cargo-deny` (advisories + bans + sources) + `gitleaks` (full history). Running on every push re-checks a tagged release against the latest advisory DB before it ships, not only at PR time. License policy is not here — it runs advisory in `security`. See [Security](#security).

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>package</em></summary>

<br>

**Trigger**: `branch push`.

`cargo package --locked` builds the crate from its packaged tarball — the same bytes `cargo install` would compile downstream — after [`rust/native-deps`](#composable-actions) supplies any `-sys` toolchain. A compile-time asset (`include_str!` / `include_bytes!` / `build.rs` input) silently dropped from the package fails the PR here. `publish`'s own `cargo publish` verify build is the tag-time twin; `preflight` builds from the work tree and would not catch it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>publish</em></summary>

<br>

**Trigger**: `tag push`. Gated by `security-gate` (`needs:`) — cargo-deny and gitleaks must pass first — and skipped if `dist-build` fails, so a broken binary build never produces a crates.io publish.

**Sequence**:
1. Checkout `main` with full history
2. Verify `main` HEAD matches the tag SHA via [`release/verify-tag`](#composable-actions)
3. Run [`check-docs`](#composable-actions)
4. Run [`rust/base`](#composable-actions)
5. Pin `Cargo.toml` to the tag via [`rust/pin-version`](#composable-actions)
6. Generate `CHANGELOG.md` section via [`release/generate-changelog`](#composable-actions)
7. `cargo publish` to crates.io — OIDC by default, token bootstrap for a new crate (see [Security](#security))
8. Create GitHub Release via [`release/github-release`](#composable-actions) — a draft when the consumer ships binaries (undrafted once assets upload), else final
9. Commit `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `CHANGELOG.md` back to `main` via [`release/commit-artifacts`](#composable-actions)

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>binary distribution (opt-in)</em></summary>

<br>

**Trigger**: `tag push`, only when `Cargo.toml` declares `[package.metadata.dist]` (cargo-dist `0.32.0`). Library crates skip every job below with zero config; the release stays non-draft as above.

The shared pipeline is the sole release authority — `publish` creates the one GitHub Release (a draft for binary repos), and these jobs attach artifacts to it. cargo-dist (`dist`) only builds, never owns the release.

- **`dist-plan`** — detects the metadata, pins the version, runs `dist plan` to compute the per-target build matrix.
- **`dist-build`** — matrix over the declared `targets`, gated by `security-gate` (`needs:`); caches `~/.cargo` + `target/` per target via `rust-cache`; builds each prebuilt archive (`dist build --artifacts=local`). Exports `CARGO_DIST_TARGET` so the consumer's `ci/setup.sh` provisions the cross-toolchain.
- **`dist-host`** — builds the global installers + Homebrew formula + npm shim (`dist build --artifacts=global`; final download URLs derive from repo + tag), uploads every asset to the release, then undrafts it.
- **`dist-publish`** — commits the formula to the declared `tap` (`HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`, rebase-retried so concurrent releases don't clobber the shared tap) and publishes the npm shim with provenance (token bootstrap or OIDC, attested via the job's `id-token` either way). Each self-skips when its installer or secret is absent.

`dist` is installed prebuilt and SHA-256 verified (version `0.32.0`) via [`rust/install-dist`](#composable-actions). Per-target Cargo features are not expressible in cargo-dist 0.32.0. Set them consumer-side via `cfg`, e.g. a Metal build gated on `cfg(target_os = "macos")`. The shared dist binaries are CPU-only; a consumer MAY keep a supplemental per-package workflow for GPU/accelerated builds (e.g. a Metal smoke). macOS Developer-ID signing + notarization are deferred.

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>security</em></summary>

<br>

**Trigger**: `every call`. Calls the advisory [`security.yml`](#securityyml) — `dependency-review` + `licenses`, reporting only, never blocks the release.

</details>

### `security-gate.yml`

The blocking gate, split from the advisory layer so it can be owned as a black box. Two parallel jobs, both fail the release through the caller's `needs:` graph — a dev can't bypass them:

- **`supply-chain`** — auto-routed by ecosystem: a `Cargo.toml` repo runs [`security/rust/cargo-deny`](#composable-actions) (advisories + bans + sources); any other runs [`security/osv-scanner`](#composable-actions). One tool per repo, never both, so a crate isn't vuln-scanned twice. A repo with no supported manifest skips (osv's no-manifest path).
- **`secret-scan`** — [`security/gitleaks`](#composable-actions), full git history, canonical ruleset.

Imposed on every package pipeline (a `security-gate` job `needs:`-ed by `publish`) and importable directly by a non-package repo. Holds only what *blocks*: a compromised dependency or a leaked secret. License and quality policy live in `security.yml`.

### `security.yml`

The advisory layer — reports, never blocks (parity with GitLab's `allow_failure: true`):

- **`dependency-review`** — PR-only; needs repo's **Dependency graph** enabled. Fails on high-severity CVE introduced by the dep diff. Uses `actions/dependency-review-action@v4`.
- **`licenses`** — Rust-only (`continue-on-error`): [`security/rust/cargo-deny`](#composable-actions) `checks: licenses` against the canonical allow-list. A non-allowed license is surfaced, never blocks the release. Skips a repo with no `Cargo.toml`.

---

**Notes** — pin via `@v0` (rolling major) or `@x.y.z`. `self-release.yml` moves `v0` to each stable release, so `@v0` always tracks the latest. `@x.y.z` pins the workflow file. The composite actions it calls are hardcoded `@v0`, so `@x.y.z` is not a full freeze — the nested actions still follow `v0`. Each `publish` `needs:` the `security-gate` job, so the release is re-checked (cargo-deny or osv-scanner, plus gitleaks) before it ships. The `security` job scans in parallel for reporting — it does not gate `publish` (see [Security](#security)).

## Composable actions

| Action | Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `check-docs` | transverse | Context dump + documentation check. |
| `javascript/base` | JavaScript | Sets up Node + corepack pnpm, caches the store, writes `.npmrc` from env, then installs, lints, builds (when present), tests. |
| `rust/base` | Rust | Installs the `rust-toolchain.toml` channel (`rustfmt` + `clippy`), caches `~/.cargo` + `target/` via `rust-cache`, runs [`rust/native-deps`](#composable-actions), then `cargo fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings`, then [`rust/test-deps`](#composable-actions) and `test`. |
| `rust/native-deps` | Rust | Runs the optional `ci/setup.sh` native build-dependency hook (sees `CARGO_DIST_TARGET` on a `dist-build` cross leg). Shared by `rust/base` and the `dist-build` matrix. No-op when absent. |
| `rust/test-deps` | Rust | Loads the optional `ci/test.env` into the job env and runs the optional `ci/test-setup.sh` fixture hook before `cargo test`. Used by `rust/base`. No-op when absent. |
| `rust/install-dist` | Rust | Installs cargo-dist's `dist` binary, prebuilt and SHA-256 verified (Linux/macOS/Windows). Shared by the `dist-plan`, `dist-build`, `dist-host` jobs. |
| `rust/pin-version` | Rust | Installs version-pinned `cargo-set-version` (cargo-edit) and stamps `Cargo.toml` to the release tag. Shared by `publish` and the `dist-*` jobs. |
| `security/gitleaks` | transverse | Installs gitleaks (SHA-256 verified), scans with the canonical ruleset, emits SARIF. Behind `security-gate.yml`'s `secret-scan` and self-CI. |
| `security/osv-scanner` | transverse | Scans dependency manifests for known vulnerabilities (OSV.dev); skips a repo with no supported manifest. Behind `security-gate.yml`'s `supply-chain` (non-Rust) and self-CI. |
| `security/rust/cargo-deny` | Rust | Runs cargo-deny against the canonical imposed `security/deny.toml` (sparse-checked from `coroboros/ci`, no consumer override). The `checks` input selects which checks run — `advisories bans sources` for the `security-gate.yml` supply-chain, `licenses` for the `security.yml` advisory layer. |
| `release/verify-tag` | transverse | Fails the release unless the checked-out `main` HEAD matches the tag SHA. Shared by the npm and Rust `publish` jobs — the tag-time jobs that check out `main` to push back; the `dist-*` jobs pin to the tag commit (`github.sha`) instead. |
| `release/generate-changelog` | transverse | SemVer-strict tag guard + generates or reuses the `## vX.Y.Z` section in `CHANGELOG.md` from Conventional Commits. Outputs `body`. Idempotent. |
| `release/github-release` | transverse | Creates the GitHub Release for the current tag, optionally as a `draft`. Body typically chained from `release/generate-changelog` (see [Examples](#examples)). |
| `release/commit-artifacts` | transverse | Stages the given files and commits them back to `main` as `chore: release ${tag} [skip ci]`. No-op when nothing changed. |

---

## Development flow

Develop with Conventional Commits → tag → push. No manual CHANGELOG, no version bump.

Tags follow **SemVer strict** — `1.2.3`, never `v1.2.3`.

<details>
<summary><em>Branch models</em></summary>

<br>

**main-only** — feature branch → PR → squash-merge to `main` → tag the merge commit → push.

**develop + main** — PR into `develop` → tag → `release/x.y.z` branch → merge to `main` → `main` reflects production.

Nobody pushes directly to protected branches (`main`, `develop`, `release/x.y.z`).

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Conventional Commits → CHANGELOG</em></summary>

<br>

| Commit type | CHANGELOG subsection |
| :--- | :--- |
| `feat` | Features |
| `fix` | Fixes |
| `refactor` | Refactor |
| `perf` | Performance |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `chore` / `ci` / `build` | Configuration |
| `test` | Tests |
| `style` | Style |
| Other / non-standard | Others |
| `!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` | Breaking Changes (always first) |

Section format: `## vX.Y.Z - DD/MM/YYYY`. Idempotent. Reuses an existing hand-curated section for the tag if present.

</details>

---

## Environment

Zero `inputs:` — configuration flows through the caller's `secrets:` block. Every npm-publish-related value is a **secret** (encrypted at rest, masked in logs); none are GitHub `vars`.

<details>
<summary><em>Secrets (caller's <code>secrets:</code> block)</em></summary>

<br>

| name | required | description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `NPM_CONFIG_FILE` | ✔ | `.npmrc` content. Written to repo root by `javascript/base`. `${VAR}` references inside are expanded by npm at install time. |
| `NPM_EXTRA_CONFIG` |  | Extra `.npmrc` lines appended after `NPM_CONFIG_FILE`. A **secret** — it lands in `.npmrc`, so it can carry auth material and must stay masked. |
| `NPM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` | ✔ | npm package registry URL. |
| `NPM_PACKAGE_PROXY_REGISTRY` |  | Optional npm proxy registry URL. |
| `NPM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY_TOKEN` |  | npm Granular Access Token, scoped to the publishing organization with create-new-package permission. Required only for the token bootstrap (first publish of a new scoped package, before npm Trusted Publisher is bound). Absent → OIDC. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Secrets — <code>rust-packages.yml</code></em></summary>

<br>

All optional. A consumer that wires none still gets crates.io plus prebuilt archives and installers on the release; Homebrew and npm activate only when their secret (or OIDC) is configured.

| name | required | description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` |  | crates.io token. Bootstraps the first publish of a new crate; absent → OIDC Trusted Publishing. |
| `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` |  | Push access to the Homebrew tap repo named by `tap` in `[package.metadata.dist]`. Absent → the formula publish self-skips. |
| `NPM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY_TOKEN` |  | npm token bootstrapping the first publish of the binary npm shim; absent → OIDC Trusted Publisher. The shim publishes with provenance either way. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><em><code>javascript/base</code> env contract (standalone composition)</em></summary>

<br>

A composite reads `env`, not `secrets:`. Composing `javascript/base` outside the bundled pipeline, set the same `NPM_CONFIG_FILE` (required, fails if missing) and `NPM_EXTRA_CONFIG` (optional) from the Secrets table above at the caller's workflow- or job-level `env:`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><em><code>release/*</code> composites I/O</em></summary>

<br>

**`release/generate-changelog`** — no inputs, no secrets. Reads `GITHUB_REF_NAME`. Requires `fetch-depth: 0` for `git describe`. Output:

| output | description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `body` | CHANGELOG section body — use as release notes. |

**`release/github-release`** — input:

| input | required | description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `body` | ✔ | Release notes body, typically `steps.<id>.outputs.body` from `release/generate-changelog`. |

Caller job needs `permissions: contents: write`. Uses `${{ github.token }}` internally via `GH_TOKEN`.

</details>

---

## Security

<details>
<summary><em>Supply chain — npm</em></summary>

<br>

The target: a hijacked maintainer, a typosquat, a `postinstall` payload, or a fresh bad version pulled before it is caught. `javascript/base` enforces four layers — the runner equivalent of the GitLab pipeline's image-baked hardening:

| Layer | Mechanism | Where |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cooldown | versions under 7 days old are quarantined; `@coroboros/*` excluded so internal publishes flow immediately | consumer `pnpm-workspace.yaml` |
| Firewall | Socket Firewall (`sfw`) proxies the fetch, blocks confirmed-malicious packages before download | `javascript/base` |
| No install scripts | `--ignore-scripts` blocks `postinstall` code execution | `javascript/base` + `.npmrc` |
| Frozen lockfile | `--frozen-lockfile` rejects a stale or tampered `pnpm-lock.yaml` | `javascript/base` |

Cooldown is consumer config — pnpm 11 reads `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`minimum-release-age` in `.npmrc` on pnpm 10.x):

```yaml
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
minimumReleaseAge: 10080            # 7 days, in minutes
minimumReleaseAgeExclude:
  - '@coroboros/*'                  # internal packages install immediately
```

**Honest gaps.** `sfw` is fail-closed — if it can't install or run, the job fails rather than fetch unprotected. It inspects public-registry fetches out of the box; packages pulled through a private proxy pass uninspected, held instead by the cooldown. pnpm itself is corepack-resolved from `packageManager`, so no floating version reaches the runner.

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Supply chain — Rust (<code>rust-packages.yml</code>)</em></summary>

<br>

GitHub-hosted runners share no hardened base image, so the Rust pipeline enforces its supply-chain controls in the workflow:

| Risk | Rust control |
| :--- | :--- |
| Untrusted source, typosquat | `cargo-deny` sources — crates.io only; git and alternative registries denied |
| Lock drift, tampered dependencies | committed `Cargo.lock` + `--locked` on `clippy` and `test` — fails on a stale or altered lock |
| Known vulnerability | `cargo-deny` advisories — RustSec vulnerabilities, unmaintained, unsound, yanked |
| License drift | `cargo-deny` licenses — allow-list, **advisory** (reports, never blocks) |
| Banned or wildcard dependency | `cargo-deny` bans |

`cargo-deny`'s blocking checks (`advisories`, `bans`, `sources`) run in [`security-gate.yml`](#security-gateyml)'s `supply-chain` on every push and gate `publish` (`needs:`), so a tagged release is re-checked against the latest advisory DB before it ships. `licenses` runs advisory in `security.yml` — reported, never blocking, since licenses are compliance rather than a supply-chain risk. The controls above are **imposed**: cargo-deny applies the canonical [`security/deny.toml`](security/deny.toml) via `--config`, sparse-checked from `coroboros/ci` — the [`gitleaks`](#composable-actions) model. A consumer `deny.toml` is ignored; a `deny.exceptions.toml` fails the job. Exceptions are changed centrally in `coroboros/ci`, never per repo — an unfixable transitive advisory is suppressed by a PR adding a justified `ignore = ["RUSTSEC-…"]` (with a `# why` comment) to the canonical `deny.toml`.

**Publish auth.** crates.io publish uses OIDC Trusted Publishing by default — `rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action` mints a short-lived token per run, no long-lived secret in the repo. `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` is needed only to bootstrap the first publish of a new crate (Trusted Publishing binds to an existing crate); configure Trusted Publishing on crates.io afterwards and drop the token. The verify build runs on publish (no `--no-verify`). It compiles the packaged tarball standalone, catching a crate that only builds in-workspace before the immutable release lands.

Two residual risks have no clean CI control. Both are documented here:
- **Build scripts run.** `cargo` has no `--ignore-scripts`; `build.rs` and proc-macros execute at build time. `--locked`, `cargo-deny` bans, and dependency review reduce the exposure; they do not remove it.
- **No publish cooldown.** crates.io has no `minimumReleaseAge`, so a freshly hijacked version is held off by the committed lock and `cargo-deny` advisories rather than a time delay.

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Recommended <code>NPM_CONFIG_FILE</code> contents</em></summary>

<br>

Minimal hardened `.npmrc` for every Coroboros consumer. Stored as a **secret** (encrypted; carries `${VAR}` expansions resolved at install time):

```ini
@coroboros:registry=https:${NPM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY}
save-exact=true
fund=false
audit=false
ignore-scripts=true
package-lock=false
lockfile=true
prefer-online=true
```

| Line | Why |
| :--- | :--- |
| `@coroboros:registry=https:${NPM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY}` | Scope-resolved registry — `${NPM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY}` expands from the same-named secret. |
| `save-exact=true` | Pin exact versions on `add` / `install`. |
| `fund=false` | Suppress funding noise in CI logs. |
| `audit=false` | `osv-scanner` (in `security-gate.yml`) covers vulnerability scans natively. |
| `ignore-scripts=true` | Defense in depth against postinstall supply-chain attacks — backs up the `--ignore-scripts` flag already passed by `javascript/base` on every `pnpm install`. |
| `package-lock=false` | Prevent `npm` from emitting a parasitic `package-lock.json` in pnpm repos. |
| `lockfile=true` | Explicit `pnpm-lock.yaml` enablement. Required on pnpm `< 11.0.0` consumers, where the preceding `package-lock=false` is interpreted as `lockfile=false` and collides with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Pnpm `>= 11` already defaults to `true` and ignores `package-lock` for `pnpm-lock.yaml`, so the line is harmless there. |
| `prefer-online=true` | Re-fetch dep metadata each install — local cache cannot mask a yanked or republished version. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Publish — OIDC vs token bootstrap</em></summary>

<br>

Auto-detected by `NPM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY_TOKEN` **secret** presence on the consumer repo:

| Token secret | Mode | Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| absent | **OIDC + provenance** (default) | `pnpm publish --provenance --no-git-checks` |
| present | **Token bootstrap** | `npm publish --ignore-scripts --access public` |

**OIDC + provenance** — no long-lived token in the repo; npm trusts a per-run id-token issued by GitHub Actions for `coroboros/<repo>/ci.yml`. Requires the npm Trusted Publisher form, which only accepts an existing package — so the very first publish has to take the token bootstrap below.

**Token bootstrap** — publishes the first version of a new scoped package. Set two additional **secrets** on the consumer (encrypted; forwarded via the caller's `secrets:` block):

| Secret | Contents |
| :--- | :--- |
| `NPM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY_TOKEN` | npm Granular Access Token scoped to the publishing organization with create-new-package permission. Long-lived; revoke after migrating to OIDC. |
| `NPM_EXTRA_CONFIG` | `${NPM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY}:_authToken=${NPM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY_TOKEN}` — appended to `.npmrc` by `javascript/base`. Stored as a **secret** because it carries auth expansion. |

`npm publish` is used on the bootstrap path (not `pnpm publish`) because pnpm `>= 11.1.3` in CI auto-attempts the OIDC token exchange and does not fall back to the `.npmrc` token if OIDC fails. `--ignore-scripts --access public` skips publish-time lifecycle hooks (`prepublishOnly` excepted — known `npm` behavior). The published tarball is identical to `pnpm publish`'s.

After the first publish, configure the npm Trusted Publisher form (Publisher type: GitHub Actions; Organization: the publishing org; Repository: consumer repo; Workflow filename: `ci.yml`; Environment: empty), then open a `chore(ci):` PR dropping `NPM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY_TOKEN` + `NPM_EXTRA_CONFIG` from the caller's `secrets:` block. Revoke the npm token. `1.0.1+` publishes via OIDC + provenance.

<summary><em>Secret isolation</em></summary>

<br>

Each `workflow_call.secrets:` block declares ONLY the secrets the job consumes. No `secrets: inherit` anywhere.

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Action pinning + Dependabot</em></summary>

<br>

Third-party actions across workflows + composites are pinned to a commit SHA with an inline `# vX` comment. Floating refs (`@master`, `@main`, `@vX`) are banned.

Self-CI binaries pinned by version. `actionlint` and `gitleaks` install from release tarballs with SHA-256 verification; `yamllint` via `pip install` with version pin. No `curl | bash`.

`.github/dependabot.yml` opens weekly grouped auto-PRs to bump pinned SHAs across `.github/workflows/*` and `.github/actions/**/action.yml`. Consumers should add their own ecosystem entries (e.g., `npm`).

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Canonical gitleaks config</em></summary>

<br>

Canonical ruleset at `security/.gitleaks.toml` in this repo. Stack-specific rules cover Resend, Neon Postgres, PostHog, and GitHub fine-grained PATs on top of the gitleaks defaults.

The `security/gitleaks` composite sparse-checks the file out of `coroboros/ci` at runtime — imposed, no consumer override.
